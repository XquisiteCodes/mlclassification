# Image Classification of Hotels and Non-Hotels

This project is carried out for the purpose of building a machine learning model for classifying images of Hotes from Non-hotels

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Python distribution

```
Anaconda

```

### Installing

Install Anaconda python distribution on your system

Use the pip package to create virtual environment (VENV) using the requirements file

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

#If there is an app folder skip this step

``` python3 -m venv app```

#Activate the virtual environment (VENV)

```
LINUX/Mac: source app/bin/activate
Windows: app\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install dependencies in VENV using requirements file

```
pip3 install -r  env/requirements.txt
``` 

## Deployment

Start app (Make sure to enter a valid path to a file or a folder)

```
python3 app.py
```

Example of valid path

```
File path: ./predict/hotel/kimono-1986491_640.jpg

Folder path: ./predict
```

### Train App

Make sure to enter absolute path

```
python3 train_model.py
```
